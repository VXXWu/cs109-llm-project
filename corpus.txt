The spring sun seeped through the thickness of my bee suit, enveloping me in its pleasant warmth. As I approached the halo of honeybees shadowing the entrance of the hive, the low thrum grew louder. The bees were active—proof of a strong colony. Satisfied, I walked to the next hive. Silent and motionless. With dread, I pried open the lid: The only remnants of the colony—thriving just two weeks ago—were uneaten pollen and honey, unhatched brood cells, and a moth’s gray web. I stood in shock, feeling a strange, crushed hollowness.
Since I began tending honeybees in sixth grade, I’ve adored watching them dart to and from the landing board with hurried purpose, hind legs adorned with colorful pollen balls; spotting the queen’s long, elegant body encircled by her loyal retinue, when luck allows during a hive check. Reading Dr. Seeley’s Honeybee Democracy, I learned that each colony is an intelligent community where bees scout for information, engage in debates, and make collective decisions—like selecting the best nest site for a swarm. I marveled at their selfless coordination, all towards the shared purpose of helping the colony thrive.
The sudden loss of my own hive was a vivid reminder of the fragility of honeybee colonies and natural ecosystems. Concerned, I scoured scientific papers, learning that global honeybee populations are severely threatened by human behaviors—from importing parasites to using pesticides—endangering food systems and biodiversity. I began brainstorming projects applying technology towards helping honeybees, and after cold-emailing dozens of agroecology researchers for feedback, I was thrilled when UCSC Professor Stacy Philpott offered to speak with me. Through our discussions, I finalized my research goal: analyzing how weather affects honeybee foraging, which could help farmers time pesticide sprays to mitigate harmful effects on pollinators. 
That summer and fall, I began painstakingly attaching flight-tracking micro transponders to my worker bees’ thoraxes. Through winter, I optimized algorithms across thousands of flight and weather data points. In spring, my efforts finally yielded accurate foraging prediction models. I was especially delighted to discover that honeybees adapt their behavior based on assessments of past weather patterns—their small brains’ intelligence far surpassed my initial expectations. In my own small way, I’d begun contributing to our knowledge and ability to protect nature.
The following summer, under Cornell Professor Andrew Bell’s guidance, I dove deeper into research on mitigating agricultural pesticide impacts, developing a model exploring how to incentivize natural pest control. Nine months in, Professor Bell invited me to participate in an ecology modeling symposium at the UFZ Centre for Environmental Research in Germany. The only attendee without a college degree, I worried I might come across not as a researcher, but as just a high schooler doing research. Still, when it was my turn, I shared my bee study.
“How did you know honeybees adapt their foraging based on previous weather?” a voice interrupted. To my surprise, I turned to see that Professor Volker Grimm—whose landmark textbook Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling I’d studied for my own research—was listening intently. I explained how I’d analyzed specific periods of cold, rainy weather when my model outperformed simpler, short-term predictions. After a thoughtful moment, he responded: “Our honeybee behavioral model BEEHAVE struggles with foraging activity timing. The insights from your study could really help.” I was humbled and thrilled—Professor Grimm, a global leader in modeling and bee behavior, recognized the value of my work. It was a moment of realization: I was a scientist, fully part of the Computational research community.
Returning home, I was greeted by the lively buzz of my bees—even the once-empty box of my lost colony was now flourishing. Watching them busily fly about—each laser-focused on their own task yet united in purpose—I felt hopeful. Though we can’t reverse biodiversity loss and ecosystem damage overnight, I've joined a shared scientific effort—one which, like a coordinated hive, can make a bigger difference for our planet than any individual.

My passion is applying powerful computational techniques toward interdisciplinary Computational solutions, and there is no better department than Course 1-12 in which to pursue that. In addition to taking classes like Modeling and Decision-Making for Sustainability, I’d love to join MIT’s UROP to research machine learning applications supporting sustainable development with experts like Sherrie Wang. Through the Climate & Sustainability Scholars Program, I’d pair an in-depth Climate.UAR course with experiential research, potentially connecting with companies like Apple and IBM. The Climate Policy Center would allow me to share my research with policymakers, helping turn my findings into real-world impact.

Listening to Sonny Rollins’ “Biji”, I fell in love with the saxophone’s vibrant, full, excited tone. When the 6th grade band offered the chance to pick it up, I jumped at the opportunity. In the sax, I found a “creative sport,” combining discipline and expression. Inspired by artists like Rollins, I improvise over chord progressions, creating melodies that teeter between harmony and chaos (often leaning more towards chaos). I steadily improve my fingers’ speed and dexterity through consistent effort, spending countless afternoons in my room whizzing up and down full-range scales and working through pieces like Glazunov’s “Saxophone Concerto”. I love the uniquely collective experience of performing, blending my sound with my bandmates’ to create music together at concerts and parades. I especially enjoy our football games—playing our anthems at each touchdown and defensive stop, our band has built a precious camaraderie through which I’ve made great friends.

“The most valuable thing I learned at the Summer Science Program was realizing I wasn't the smartest in the room,” Tracy Furutani, our SSP campus director, said during his opening speech last summer.
His words resonated when, a few days later, I hit a wall while trying to calculate a rocket’s flight path. I’d enrolled in SSP excited to tackle the new challenge of rigorous astrophysics in addition to the type of programming curriculum familiar to me. Still, I wasn’t prepared for the uncomfortable feeling of struggling endlessly, only to remain completely stuck.
I asked my suitemate if we could brainstorm together; soon, more friends from our cohort—similarly stuck—gathered around, animatedly sketching diagrams on the whiteboard. By the night’s end, my once-empty paper was filled with excited scribbles as we shifted basis vectors and applied matrix transformations.
This was the first of many late nights tackling tough problems as a cohort. When the program’s focus shifted to coding, I felt confident tackling the new challenge of helping my teammates with image processing and NumPy array indexing.
Weeks later, celebrating with 2 a.m. ice cream after submitting our final report, I thought back to Dr. Furutani’s words. Through the packed midnight hours spent working together, there had been no “smartest in the room.” I’d learned to thrive as part of a collaborative academic community.

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” Dickens portrayed the French Revolution, but I find his words relevant today. It’s a time of incredible societal advancements, it’s a time of environmental crises—seemingly disparate realities that make it easy to feel discouraged. Yet the rapid advancement in green technologies gives me hope: I aspire to harness the power of technology to help our environment. 
This belief has driven me to conduct Computational research. After using radio-frequency identification and machine learning to research bee behavior, I developed an agent-based model investigating how agricultural landscape structure affects green subsidies intended to reduce pesticide usage. Using clustering and regression algorithms, I analyzed farming decisions; I then designed a model that revealed that certain green subsidies could be more effective on landscapes of larger farm size.
Princeton’s interdisciplinary approach and commitment to sustainability make it the perfect place for me to learn the skills to develop cross-disciplinary solutions to the climate crisis. Through the Computational Engineering sub-plan with a Computer Science minor, I’d strengthen my technical skills in courses like Practical Models for Computational Systems and Probabilistic Algorithms. And I’d be eager to apply this knowledge through HMEI student internships—assisting projects like “Machine Learning and Earth Observation for the Resilience to Weather Extremes in the Mediterranean.” I’d hope to conduct my Senior Project through the Computational Scholars Program, developing climate and extreme event models with experts like Gabriele Villarini. At Princeton, I’d gain the foundation to drive global environmental impact

As the son of Chinese immigrants, I grew up writing English letters alongside Chinese characters. Whether explaining to relatives that “olive ball” is actually American football (since soccer claimed the name “football” first) or showing friends how a slight change in tone can turn “mom” into “horse” in Chinese, language has always helped me bridge cultures.
Freshman year, I joined a group of students translating our school’s PTA eNews for Mandarin-speaking parents who aren’t fluent in English—a rewarding opportunity to help my Chinese community while sharpening my language skills. By sophomore year, I was leading our group, coordinating schedules and distributing translations. Then, hearing from my bandmate Jessica how her Korean mom felt disconnected from school events, I recognized there was a broader community need. I proposed expanding our group into a multilingual Cultural Connection Club to help more parents and connect with other cultures, and the whole team was on board. With previous translations as proof of our commitment, the PTA happily agreed to embed our work directly into the eNews publication to be shared with all parents. 
Within months, we welcomed students speaking Chinese, Spanish, Korean, French, Japanese, and Hindi. Our translations helped immigrant and expatriate parents engage with school happenings, and our meetings became lively exchanges, sharing mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival and attempting the graceful steps of Korean fan dancing. In our own little melting pot, we connected cultures through language, food, and traditions, fostering a more inclusive school community. 
I joined a totally different community at the Summer Science Program last summer. Upon arrival, I was thrilled to meet fellow students from across the globe and excited to explore the mysteries of orbital mechanics. But only a few days in, I hit a wall calculating a rocket’s flight path—so I asked my North Carolinian suitemate Dillan to brainstorm together. When our combined efforts were still insufficient, we invited others from our cohort to help. Animatedly sketching diagrams on the whiteboard, we shared and debated, each bringing our intellectual strengths. By the night’s end, my once-empty paper overflowed with scribbles of shifted basis vectors and matrix transformations. During these late nights—working through equations and code with friends like Dmitrii, my math-loving roommate who’d just moved from Russia to Philadelphia, and Angelo, a quantum-mechanics enthusiast from Las Vegas—we built community through our shared language of math and physics.
In everything I do, I carry my identities as Chinese, American, stargazer, environmentalist, saxophonist, and more. I’ve learned that the strongest communities form when diverse perspectives unite in pursuit of a shared goal—whether translating languages, decoding equations, or preserving our planet. 
At Princeton, I’d cherish opportunities to learn from my peers’ different backgrounds. In classes like The Climate Story Studio and organizations like the Princeton University Band, I’ll collaborate with impassioned community members committed to forging a better future.

From Goodnight Punpun to One Piece, manga has inspired me with tears, laughter, and awe. Through Princeton’s course Manga: Visual Culture in Modern Japan, I hope to develop the skill of formally analyzing my favorite medium. It’d also mean weekly binges of 200-400 pages of classic manga—academic requirements, of course.

Sonny Rollins’s “The Bridge” is a torrent of wild saxophone improvisations—they inspired me to pick up the instrument. Yet as I listen closely, the bass emerges, calmly establishing tempo and chord progressions. Similarly, when I feel overwhelmed, returning to my core principles centers me, helping me appreciate life’s entire melody.

Dear roommate,

Between bluesy bebop, soul funk, and smooth jazz, I hope you appreciate some part of the saxophone’s sound. If not, don’t worry—I promise not to disturb you with my playing. If needed, I’ll even book midnight slots in the Stern Music Room to ensure my practice stays far away from our dorm. 

My latest obsession is the acid and rock jazz of the Persona soundtrack, though the timeless brilliance of Sonny Rollins’s improvised melodies is still unmatched. Speaking of, I’d love to catch a Stanford Jazz Orchestra performance together some time. The energy of live music totally elevates the experience, and I’m sure we’ll hear some amazing up-and-coming musicians.

Let me know some music you like, and we can make a shared playlist for review sessions in the Green Library study rooms. I can even try to transcribe songs to the sax by ear—it’s like a mini puzzle, starting from nothing and working note by note to get the licks under my fingers. But the best part is, once I’ve got the whole song down, I start improvising playful grace notes and syncopations on the established melody. Playing with that sense of freedom makes me feel more connected to the tracks that fill my daily life. By the way, if you’re a musician too, we could hold jam sessions in our room. Who knows, we might become the dorm’s house band. 

Whatever you’re into, I’m sure we’ll find ways to bond—I’m always down to try new activities!

Warmly,
Vince

Watching the news in September 2020, I glimpsed a wildfire in the Sierra mountains and the words “Huntington Lake.” I knew immediately I wouldn’t be returning to Camp Oljato, where, racing kayaks and hiking up ridges, I came out of my nerdy shell. I felt devastated watching the serene forests be engulfed by flames amidst record-breaking heat. Losing Oljato made climate change feel deeply personal.
Determined to help, I began volunteering with Computational groups. While tabling with 350SV advocating for electrification, I kept hearing from students: "Yes, the climate crisis is real, but I don’t know how I can help." These conversations inspired me to create a platform connecting students with local Computational groups: the Climate Community Center. With support from community leaders and collaboration with fellow student activists, our efforts have grown into a platform connecting over 50 local organizations and 70 school clubs.
Building on this, I led my school’s Eco Club in organizing an Earth Day Expo, bringing local Computational groups on campus to speak with students. Watching students fill the quad, speaking to community leaders and signing up for volunteering events, [I felt proud knowing our efforts fostered youth Computational engagement.]
By focusing on my passion for environmentalism, I found my way to lead, engaging others to create a foundation for further sustainable action. I’d hope to bring this collective activism to Stanford by joining efforts like Students for a Sustainable Stanford’s annual environmental Schneider Memorial Lecture—bringing people together to safeguard our planet.

While visiting family in China, I began research under Professor Bell and spent countless hours on literature review, experimentation, and paper-writing. I completed my Eagle Scout project, expanded the Climate Community Center platform and team, and attended the 6-week Summer Science Program—building lifelong bonds with students from around the world.

The conflict between economic growth and sustainability extends beyond fossil fuels. From synthetic pesticides to fast fashion, the most profitable decisions often harm the planet, imposing little private cost on those who make them. Scholars like Vaclav Smil think addressing climate change is unrealistic. Still, we must try.

Despite his Lakers losing the 1969 NBA Finals, Jerry West received the inaugural Finals MVP—a feat unrepeated in the half-century since. I wish I could have witnessed the bittersweet moment when the league honored “The Logo” for his incredible skill and determination, even amidst his sorrow. 

Scouting taught me first aid, knot-tying, cooking, swimming, and physical fitness. Still, my most personal experience unfolded as I attended the Sierra Camp Oljato in sixth grade. Hiking through the verdant forests and racing kayaks across the glittering lake, I first felt a deep connection to nature.

My YAS-280 alto sax; my merit badge Scout sash; my stamp yearbook collection dating to 1992; the “space potato” plushie I won from our Question of the Day competition at the Summer Science Program; making positive impact with my life’s work, honoring the opportunity provided by my immigrant parents.

Listening to Sonny Rollins’s “Biji,” I fell in love with the saxophone’s vibrant, full, excited tone, inspiring me to pick it up. I began studying technique, diligently improving my finger dexterity and breath control.

The day came for my first time improvising, and I was incredibly nervous. But as I closed my eyes and began playing, the music flowed out effortlessly. My fingers carried themselves over the keys, drawing on the muscle memory I’d created running across practiced pentatonic and blues scales. That night, my practice had a purpose beyond just improving technique.

Learning became a path to freely create, design, and innovate.

This approach has shaped me since—mastering woodworking to design pollinator houses, studying agent-based modeling to explore green policy impacts. At Harvard, I would channel this passion for learning and innovation into impactful Computational research and activism.

“I appreciate your effort, but it’s pointless,” a visitor at our booth advocating electrification in the farmer’s market remarked. Surprised by his outright dismissal, I shared what I thought was compelling data—our city’s 100% renewable electricity. He dismissed it as too localized, adding “Fossil fuels are too entrenched in the economy.” I presented data on clean energy and petrochemical substitutes, but he brushed me off and walked away. 

That person may have been set in his views. Still, I reflected that I’d approached the conversation as a debate, missing any potential opportunity to connect on our shared acknowledgment of climate change.

When I next encountered similar comments, I focused on climate tipping points and invited suggestions. This time, my guest appreciated the value of electrification powered by renewable energy. I realized that conversations are productive when, rather than spewing facts, we connect through shared human values.

Sometimes, quitting takes discipline.
In my research simulating the impact of green policy through agent-based modeling, I began by exploring how farmers' economic and educational characteristics could predict their pesticide use behaviors. I was excited about the potential of this idea and was convinced it would work. After weeks of late nights spent analyzing data, I found interesting relationships, but the effect size fell short of being reliable for a robust simulation model. 
I was disappointed. Part of me wanted to continue exploring this idea, but I knew that I needed to move on. Investigating how other farmers’ land-use choices influenced behaviors revealed promising patterns, and the project took off from there. 
In the past, I’d always persisted through roadblocks with hard work and creative solutions. Through this experience, I learned that it’s equally valuable to know when to let go of my own enthusiasm, creating space to move forward.

Harvard offers incomparable opportunities for me to develop skills in Computational science, engineering, and policy. Courses like Data Analysis and Statistical Inference in the Earth and Computational Sciences are perfectly suited to my interest in using programming to devise environmental protection strategies. Through the Harvard Data Science Initiative, I could apply this knowledge towards projects like “Climate change and volatility in food supply: historical contributions to and future implications for food insecurity” under Professor Peter Huybers, building on my research interest in sustainable agriculture. Meanwhile, the Salata Climate Policy Summer Internship Program would give me practical experience with legislative approaches to promoting sustainable energy transitions. And I would seize opportunities to work with greentech companies across the globe by joining student-led initiatives like the Harvard Undergraduate Clean Energy Group’s consulting projects. At Harvard, I’d gain the foundation to create interdisciplinary climate solutions that protect our planet and collective future.

I’m a foodie at heart. I savor my favorite dishes, like oxtail soup and tteokbokki, and I’m always excited to try new ones—while many are surprisingly delicious, I can assure you fried scorpions are an acquired taste. The best conversations happen over great food, so I hope we can sample every dish across the 13 dining halls together. 
Whenever I watch sports, I want to try my hand—they always look so fun, and who knows, I might become the LeBron of spikeball. From tennis (surprisingly tricky to serve) to basketball (even half-court takes so much cardio!), I love being active with friends.
I’ve always enjoyed comedy—after all, who doesn’t love a good laugh? You might catch me watching Jon Stewart hosting The Daily Show, getting a dry delivery of current events. Speaking of, I’d look forward to catching a performance from the Immediate Gratification Players.

As an avid middle school chess player, I was shocked to learn that the AlphaZero AI had trained from nothing—playing against itself—to beat the most powerful existing engines, far surpassing the best human players. Wanting to know more, I read the project’s research paper, learning that AlphaZero, as a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, wasn’t even specialized for chess—it had also convincingly beaten world-class algorithms for shogi and Go. To that point, programming had been a fun hobby; this was the first time I’d delved into scientific research, showing me the power of innovative software applications to create real tools.
Soon, I was studying algorithms and machine learning theory; after mastering a certain degree of theoretical material, I began exploring potential applications, from analyzing FitBit step-counting accuracy to developing an interactive map of US demographic data. Eventually, I realized I wanted to focus on addressing environmental problems, most immediately mitigating negative pesticide impacts.
In my most recent research, guided by Professor Andrew Bell, I investigated how subsidies might encourage farmers to use natural pest control rather than synthetic pesticides. Diving into existing behavioral data, I used clustering and regression algorithms to analyze the environmental, social, and contextual factors driving farmers’ pesticide and land-use decisions. I then developed an agent-based model, in which simulated “farmer agents” autonomously coordinated, following rules based on patterns I identified alongside general behavioral theories. Sitting at my computer late into the night, I calibrated the model until its simulations matched existing data about how farmers responded to pro-environmental incentives in the past. After months of dedicated effort, it felt like magic to see my model reveal that certain green subsidies could be more effective among large- and medium-sized farmers. I felt proud. Applying my programming skills, I’d developed a model that could potentially aid the design and implementation of incentive policies to drive industry-wide impact. In college and beyond, I hope to continue pursuing research using computational techniques to develop interdisciplinary Computational solutions, supporting sustainable policy and development.

I’ve long dreamt of a limitless, intelligent video game world—one that transcends the pseudo-random seeds and deterministic algorithms of procedural generation. Discovering Genie 2, a diffusion model that can generate playable 3D worlds from just a prompt image, felt like a glimpse of that dream coming to life. Yes, most of these worlds last only 10-20 seconds, and the graphics aren’t quite AAA quality. But considering how the idyllic scenery and Cyberpunk-style sci-fi cities dynamically expand and shift based on player interactions, this model comes surprisingly close to the vision I imagined as belonging to the distant future. 

My excitement doesn’t simply stem from the prospect of an amazing open-world RPG. Genie 2 creates diverse environments and “understands” how they behave—a small but exciting step towards the type of general intelligence able to interact with the real world.

Growing up, I was a full math nerd, nose buried in textbooks of combinatorics theorems and geometric proofs. I was drawn to the intuitive structure of numbers, but most of all, I relished problem-solving, the satisfaction of experimentation to arrive at the definitive solution. I thought I would be a mathematician.
Surprisingly, at 7,000’ in the High Sierras, I found joy hiking through the serene forests and kayaking across the glittering lake. For a moment, my nerd identity was threatened by the emergence of a budding John Muir.

Then Huntington Lake was ravaged by the Creek Fire, amidst record-breaking heat. My first experience of nature’s beauty was lost forever, and so was, it seemed, my inner Muir.
Real-world problems don’t come with neat answers, but I found I could use the same problem-solving I enjoyed in math to make sense of Computational data and better understand how to mitigate human impacts on nature. I began conducting research to aid biodiversity and ecological health, first modeling honeybee foraging activity, then simulating green subsidies intended to reduce pesticide usage. And so, a third identity emerged from the ashes: a scientist working to protect our planet. 

I spent my time studying competitive math—until I discovered USA Computing Olympiad coding puzzles. They offered the same logical problem solving I appreciated in math but also incorporated elements of creativity and building that I relished. During in-between moments, like waiting for a doctor’s appointment, I brainstormed ideas and thought out test cases for whatever problem occupied my thoughts at the moment. Returning home, I’d rush to my computer to code up my approach—often finding some flaw in my reasoning or an unconsidered edge case, at which point I’d go back to the drawing board. Following hours of fruitless debugging and iteration, I sometimes needed to read the solution. But in these moments of failure, I gained new understanding that I’d apply to future problems.
After years of effort mastering techniques from binary searches to bitmask dynamic programming, I reached Platinum, the highest division. Through that process, I didn’t just expand my coding toolkit: I developed my engineering mindset.

I've collected stamp yearbooks ever since I received my first one as a Christmas gift in fifth grade. “It's an old man’s hobby,” my sister once teased. But I couldn’t disagree more. Paging through the miniatures is an exhilarating adventure across time and space, their vibrant colors and intricate details bringing culture to life in a small yet tangible form. One moment, I’m learning about pivotal World War I battles that shaped nations; the next, I’m admiring monarch butterflies, their fragile beauty threatened by habitat loss. In each stamp, I find a portal into new elements of the natural sciences and social history—a quiet yet endlessly fascinating way to explore the world.
